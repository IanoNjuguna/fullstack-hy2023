## Full Stack Open

The content is the same as in the [Full Stack course](https://fullstackopen.com/) held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in the Spring of 2023.

### Description

This GitHub repository serves as a personal workspace for my coursework in this course. Through this repository, I am documenting and managing the code, projects, and assignments related to my web development studies.

### Course Overview

**Focus on Modern Web Development**: The coursework primarily emphasizes modern web development techniques and technologies using JavaScript as the core programming language.

**Single-Page Applications (SPA)**: The main focus is on building single-page applications (SPAs) using React.

**Web Services**: I explore the development of web services, including RESTful and GraphQL APIs, using Node.js to support my SPA projects.

**Additional Topics**: The coursework covers a range of supplementary topics, including TypeScript, React Native for mobile app development, and best practices in continuous integration.

**Debugging and Troubleshooting**: I also delve into debugging and troubleshooting techniques essential for maintaining and improving the quality of web applications.

**Containerization and Configuration**: The repository contains configurations and practices related to container technology, environment management, and database integration.


Feel free to explore the projects and code contained within this repository to follow along with my progress in web development.
